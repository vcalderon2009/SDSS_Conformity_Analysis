Quenched Fractions
==================

In this analysis, we also look at the **quenched fractions**.
For the 1-halo analysis, we look at the *quenched fraction* of
satellites around their host central galaxy, as a function of group mass.

For the 2-halo analysis, we look at the *quenched fraction* of
centrals around other centrals, as function of their
projected distance, :math:`r_{p}`.

We perform this statistic on three galaxy properties, i.e. *specific star
formation rate* (sSFR), *Sersic index* (*n*), and :math:`(g-r)` color.
